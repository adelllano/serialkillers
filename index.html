    <div class="intro">
      <p>It seems anytime a major story on a new serial killer breaks, it re-opens America's curisotiy on past prolific killers. Just recently, the confession of 90 killings from <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/vicap-links-murders-to-prolific-serial-killer-112718" target="_blank">Samuel Little</a>, ignited an interest in serial killers like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/samuel-little-ted-bundy-jeffrey-dahmer-and-other-prolific-serial-killers-throughout-history" target="_blank"> Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer.</a> </p>

      <p>There have been numerous serial killers throughout the decades, but the top ten serial killers on this list were selected based on their consistent popularity throughout various web searches and lists. The criteria for the selected killers was to have a consistent search index, verified via Google Trends, and familiarity within the community. Meaning that I asked people I knew, randomly in conversation, whether they knew the killers on the list. Almost 99% of the individuals I approached, were familiar with Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer. Once the 'top 10' list was finalized, I took the average search interest from 2004 to 2018 for each killer and arranged them based on the average search interest result.</p>

    <div class="searchinterest">

      <p>Many of the peaks in search interest, from this chart, come from a movie, documentary, or book release. Ailen Wuornos' search interest spiked when we the biographical crime film "Monster" came out in 2003. Althought our data doesn't reflect that year, you can see the decline in 2004. In 2014, search interests for Jack the Ripper peaked when a book, titled "Naming Jack the Ripper", came out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/jack-the-ripper-polish-aaron-kosminski-dna" target="_blank">claiming to have solved the 126 year old mystery of the killer's identity.</a> David Berkowitz recently gained a bit of interest in 2017, when the CBS News special, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/preview-son-of-sam-the-killer-speaks/" target="_blank">Son of Sam: The Killer Speaks"</a>, was released. This was Berkowitz' first interview in a decade. Below is a breakdown and explanation of the some of the more significant spikes in search interest throughout the years:</p>
