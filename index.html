      <h1><strong> HOW AMERICA SEARCHES FOR SERIAL KILLERS</strong></h1>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>It seems anytime a major news story on a serial killer breaks, it reopens America's curiosity on past prolific killers. Just recently, the confession of 90 killings from <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/vicap-links-murders-to-prolific-serial-killer-112718" target="_blank">Samuel Little</a>, ignited an interest in serial killers like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/samuel-little-ted-bundy-jeffrey-dahmer-and-other-prolific-serial-killers-throughout-history" target="_blank"> Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer.</a> Using data from Google Trends, we were able to find out which serial killers are commonly searched for and where these searches are coming from. Google Trends doesn't provide the total number of searches for each killer, instead it gives you a search volume index from 0 to 100 for each search. This index is the indicator for search interests (# of queries for keyword) / (total Google search queries) and was used to find the interest for serial killer over the years. Even decades after their crimes were committed, America doesn't forget the stories of their heinous acts of murder.

      <p>There have been numerous serial killers throughout the decades, but the top ten serial killers on this list were selected based on their consistent popularity throughout various web searches and lists. The criteria for these serial killers was that they have a consistent search index (since 2004), verified via Google Trends. Also, ten random students and faculty at the University of Miami were selected and asked to circle which serial killers they were familiar with, from a list of 20 killers. Almost all of the individuals surveyed were familiar with Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer. Once the 'top 10' list was finalized, the average search index was taken, from 2004 to 2018, for each killer and that number was used to arrange them in order and to identify the level of interest for each killer.</p>

      <p>Although Jeffrey Dahmer is the most commonly searched serial killer in most of North America, each killer had at least one state where they were notably more popular. In most cases, this was found to tell the story of where they were born, apprehended, where they lived, and/or where they committed their crimes.</p>

    <div class="searchinterest">

      <p>Many of the peaks within the search interest since 2004, come from a movie, documentary, news story or book release. Aileen Wuornos' search interest spiked when the biographical crime film "Monster" came out in 2003. Although the data from 2003 is not included, you are able to see a decline starting in 2004. In 2014, search interests for Jack the Ripper peaked when a book, titled "Naming Jack the Ripper", came out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/jack-the-ripper-polish-aaron-kosminski-dna" target="_blank">claiming to have solved the 126-year-old mystery of the killer's identity.</a> David Berkowitz recently gained a bit of interest in 2017, when the CBS News special, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/preview-son-of-sam-the-killer-speaks/" target="_blank">"Son of Sam: The Killer Speaks"</a>, was released. This was Berkowitz' first interview in a decade. Significant peaks in search interests from other killers are explained:</p>
